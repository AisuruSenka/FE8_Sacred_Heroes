# ABOUT THIS ROMHACK
Hello! As of present (11/14/25), this romhack is MOSTLY finished.
The only truly unfinished things are supports. The finished supports
are listed below, but more supports listings are there with
placeholder text. I do intend to come back and finish them at a
later date, but for now, I'm releasing what I have done.

Here is a non-comprehensive list changes have been made to the game,
though there are more changes that I have elected not to include
here for the sake of spoilers. Credits are contained in
a separate document. Obviously, things hidden from this document
for spoilers are included in the credits list.

Obviously, you will need to procure your own rom of
Fire Emblem: Sacred Stones to apply this patch to.

MISC. ADJUSTMENTS:

- Skills! (Note: enemies will have more skills on hard mode)

- Str and Mag are no longer the same stat;
some classes can use both physical weapons & magic/staves

- New classes, such as War Cleric & Halberdier

- New items, such as Flame Lance & Ruin (dark magic)

- All promotion items have been replaced with Master Seals

- Male and female classes have identical stat caps

- Many classes have had minor adjustments to stat caps,
and honestly I have forgotten most of them.

- Changed recruitment dialogues, endings, boss quotes, and death quotes

KNOWN BUGS:

- Some portraits will have small sections missing
when viewed in places like the character info screen (R);
this is due to the lack of mouth & eye sprites for portraits
created with the FEChar portait maker. I could splice
mouth & eye sprites, but it's a bit of a tedious process.
Maybe I'll come back to it someday.

- Initiating combat against a foe with Nihil using the
increased range from skills such as Tome Range+ or
Bow Range+ will cause the game to softlock. This is
likely due to Nihil deactivating these skills after
combat has been initiated, preventing attacks from
actually occuring. I could circumvent this by simply
removing Nihil from all enemies, but I think that
detract from the experience overall.

- Some menu text becomes slightly corrupted in menus after viewing
information for certain characters (Laevatein, Ratatoskr,
Hraesvelgr, & Laegjarn, maybe a few others I forgot). This is due
to their names being longer than 8 characters. I blame IntSys for this
one. I could shorten their names to fix this, I guess.
